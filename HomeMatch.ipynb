    "### Description:\n",
    "Personalization is key to customer satisfaction! At our company, we want to revolutionize how clients interact with real-estate listings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "Create a personalize experience for each buy, making property search process more engaging and tailored to individual preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Components of \"HomeMatchAI\"\n",
    "**Understanding Buyer Preferences:**\n",
    "- Buyers will input their requirements and preferences, such as location, property type, budget, amenities, and lifestyle choices.\n",
    "- The application uses LLMs to interpret these inputs in natural language, understanding nuanced requests beyond basic filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Integrating with a Vector Database:**\n",
    "- Connect \"HomeMatch\" with a vector database, where all available property listings are stored.\n",
    "- Utilize vector embeddings to match properties with buyer preferences, focusing on aspects like neighborhood vibes, architectural styles, and proximity to specific amenities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Personalized Listing Description Generation:**\n",
    "- For each matched listing, use an LLM to rewrite the description in a way that highlights aspects most relevant to the buyer’s preferences.\n",
    "- Ensure personalization emphasizes characteristics appealing to the buyer without altering factual information about the property.\n"
